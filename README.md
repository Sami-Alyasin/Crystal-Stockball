This is an end-to-end data science project that aims to deploy an interactive model that will predict the stock price movement of a given stock ticker for the next day.

This project will cover the following steps:
  1. **Data collection** - We will collect historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance API.
  2. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** - We will explore the historical stock price data to understand the patterns and trends.
  3. **Feature engineering** - We will create new features from the historical stock price data to help predict the stock price movement.
  4. **Modeling** - We will train, optimize, and evaluate a variety of machine learning models.
  5. **Model deployment** - Finally, we will deploy the best performing model as a web application using Streamlit.
