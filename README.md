This is an end-to-end project that will deploy a live stock price prediction model and explore how the amount of data used for training, engineered features used, model selected, and the selection of the parameters of that model contribute to its performance and efficiency. The model will be trained to generate a prediction for the selected stock's adjusted closing price.

This project will cover the following steps:
  1. **Data collection** - We will collect historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance API.
  2. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** - We will explore the historical stock price data to understand the patterns and trends.
  3. **Feature engineering** - We will create new features from the historical stock price data to help predict the stock price movement.
  4. **Modeling** - We will train, optimize, and evaluate a machine learning model.
  5. **Model deployment** - Finally, we will deploy the best performing model as a web application using Streamlit.
